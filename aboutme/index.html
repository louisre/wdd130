    <p>Hello, my name is Louis Rebolloso! I am from Miami, Florida and I am 20 years old. I just got back around 4 
    weeks ago from serving in the Mexico City Chalco Mission. I am currently on course towards obtaining a bachelor's 
    degree in Computer Science. My hobbies are fishing, weightlifting, and hunting. I am not married, but we are in the
    process of making that happen. üôè <p>
    <p>I currently don't have a job but I am looking for one. I'm trying out these Computer Science related courses
    to see if I like it. I am truly considering becoming a pilot whether it be with the airlines, cargo or the air
    force. The thing I love most about BYUI is that I'm surrounded by members. I didn't really have that in Florida.
    I was born into the covenant and my favorite scripture is Moroni 10:32 "Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in 
    him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with 
    all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in 
    Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God."</p>
