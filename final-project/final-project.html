                <h3>Freshwater & Inshore Species</h3>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Florida’s freshwater and inshore fishing regulations are essential for protecting the state’s diverse aquatic ecosystems and ensuring that fish populations remain healthy for future generations. Anglers targeting popular freshwater species, like largemouth bass, crappie, and catfish, as well as inshore saltwater species, like redfish, snook, and speckled trout, must follow specific regulations regarding bag limits, size limits, and, in some cases, slot limits. These rules are designed to allow fish populations to thrive and maintain balanced ecosystems in both fresh and brackish waters.</p>
                    <p>Bag limits control the number of fish an angler can keep each day, helping to prevent overharvesting of prized species. Size limits establish minimum lengths, ensuring younger fish have a chance to grow and spawn before being harvested. For some species, slot limits specify a size range within which fish can be kept, often protecting both very young and mature breeding fish. In certain cases, anglers may also be subject to seasonal restrictions, especially for species that have critical spawning seasons or are more vulnerable at particular times of year.</p>
                    <p>Florida's regulations for freshwater and inshore species are updated periodically, so anglers are encouraged to stay informed of the latest rules before heading out. This website makes it easy to check current regulations by species, providing a reliable resource for responsible fishing in Florida’s lakes, rivers, estuaries, and nearshore waters. By following these guidelines, anglers contribute to the long-term sustainability of Florida’s freshwater and inshore fish populations.</p>

                <h3>Offshore, Reef & Wreck Species</h3>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Florida’s offshore, wreck, and reef fishing regulations are essential for preserving the state’s rich marine ecosystems and ensuring sustainable fishing practices. For saltwater anglers, understanding these rules is critical to responsibly enjoying the vast variety of species that inhabit Florida’s waters, from snapper and grouper on the reefs to pelagic species like amberjack and king mackerel found offshore. Regulations cover several important areas, including bag limits, size limits, and boat limits, all of which vary by species.</p>
                    <p>Bag limits specify how many fish an angler can keep per day. This helps prevent overfishing by limiting the number of fish taken by each person. Size limits indicate the minimum and sometimes maximum size a fish must be to legally keep, ensuring that young fish have the opportunity to mature and reproduce before being harvested. Boat limits set the total allowable catch per vessel, even if there are multiple anglers on board.</p>
                    <p>Florida also enforces seasonal closures for certain species and designated areas to protect breeding populations. The regulations are updated regularly, so it’s important for anglers to stay informed to avoid penalties. Accessible platforms like this website make it easy to check and follow current regulations, allowing fishing enthusiasts to enjoy Florida’s waters while contributing to the health of its fisheries.</p>
