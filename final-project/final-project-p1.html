                    <p>In Florida, tarpon fishing is primarily catch-and-release, with strict regulations to protect this iconic species. There is no size limit for tarpon, but anglers can only keep one tarpon per year if they purchase a $50 tarpon tag in advance, typically for record-setting or scientific purposes. For recreational anglers, tarpon must be released immediately after capture. Tarpon larger than 40 inches must remain in the water during handling and photography to reduce stress and injury. Only one tarpon may be fought from a boat at a time, regardless of the number of anglers onboard.</p>
                    <p>Tarpon fishing is permitted year-round, with peak season occurring between April and August in areas like the Florida Keys and Boca Grande. Special regulations apply in certain areas, such as the mandatory use of non-offset circle hooks with natural bait in Boca Grande Pass and the prohibition of breakaway gear. Spearing, snagging, selling, or purchasing tarpon is illegal in Florida. Anglers must also hold a valid Florida saltwater fishing license unless exempt. Following these rules ensures sustainable tarpon populations and supports responsible fishing practices.</p>

                <div class="text-p1">
                    <p>In Florida, snook fishing is regulated to protect the species and ensure sustainability. Snook have strict slot size limits: anglers may only harvest snook measuring 28 to 32 inches on the Gulf Coast and 28 to 33 inches on the Atlantic Coast, measured from the tip of the snout to the end of the tail. The daily bag limit is one snook per angler, and harvest is only allowed during designated open seasons. The season typically opens from March 1 to May 31 and September 1 to December 15 on the Gulf Coast, and from February 1 to May 31 and September 1 to December 15 on the Atlantic Coast, but these dates can vary.</p>
                    <p>A valid Florida saltwater fishing license and a $10 snook permit are required to harvest snook. Snook must be caught using hook-and-line gear; spearing, snatching, or using nets is prohibited. Itâ€™s also important to handle snook carefully to ensure successful release, especially for those outside the slot size. Bag limits, size restrictions, and seasonal closures help maintain healthy snook populations while preserving opportunities for future anglers. Always check for updates before fishing, as regulations can change.</p>

                <div class="text-p1">
                    <p>Peacock bass fishing in Florida is managed to preserve this non-native species as a valued sport fish. Anglers are allowed to harvest up to two peacock bass per day, with a size limit permitting only one fish over 17 inches in total length. These limits are in place to maintain a balanced population while allowing recreational fishing opportunities.</p>
                    <p>Fishing for peacock bass is open year-round in Florida, primarily in freshwater systems in South Florida, including canals and urban waterways. A valid Florida freshwater fishing license is required for most anglers unless exempt. While peacock bass are non-native, they were introduced intentionally to control invasive species and are now a prized gamefish due to their fighting ability and vibrant coloration. Anglers are encouraged to handle these fish carefully to ensure sustainability and maintain the quality of the fishery. Always verify regulations before heading out, as updates may occur.</p>
