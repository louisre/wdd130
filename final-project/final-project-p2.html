                    <p>In Florida, mahi-mahi (also known as dolphinfish) fishing is regulated to support sustainable populations. The daily bag limit for recreational anglers is 10 fish per person, with a maximum of 60 fish per vessel, whichever is less. The minimum size limit is 20 inches fork length, measured from the tip of the snout to the fork of the tail. These limits apply to both state and federal waters off the Florida coast.</p>
                    <p>Mahi-mahi fishing is open year-round, with peak seasons typically occurring in the spring and summer. A valid Florida saltwater fishing license is required unless fishing on a licensed charter or exempt. Anglers are encouraged to practice ethical fishing techniques, including proper handling and releasing of undersized or excess fish. Following these regulations helps maintain the health of mahi-mahi populations and ensures the fishery remains productive for future generations. Always check for updates to rules, as they can vary between state and federal waters.</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>Blackfin tuna fishing in Florida is regulated to ensure sustainable populations while supporting recreational and commercial fishing. For recreational anglers, there is no daily bag limit or minimum size requirement in Florida state or federal waters. However, responsible fishing practices are encouraged to maintain healthy stocks.</p>
                    <p>Blackfin tuna fishing is open year-round, with peak seasons typically in the spring and fall. Anglers targeting blackfin tuna must have a valid Florida saltwater fishing license unless they are fishing from a licensed charter or are otherwise exempt. Circle hooks and proper handling techniques are recommended to minimize harm to released fish. As blackfin tuna are a popular sport fish, adhering to ethical fishing practices helps sustain the fishery and ensures its enjoyment for years to come. Always stay informed about potential regulation updates, especially when fishing in federal waters.</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>Mutton snapper fishing in Florida is regulated to protect the species and support sustainable fishing practices. The minimum size limit is 18 inches total length, and the daily bag limit is 5 fish per person within the overall 10-snapper aggregate bag limit for all snapper species. These limits apply to both state and federal waters off Florida.</p>
                    <p>The mutton snapper season is open year-round, but specific regulations may apply during spawning periods, particularly in designated areas like the Florida Keys. A valid Florida saltwater fishing license is required unless fishing from a licensed charter or exempt. Anglers should use proper handling techniques to release undersized or excess fish safely and avoid fishing in areas with spawning closures. Following these regulations helps maintain mutton snapper populations and ensures the fishery's long-term sustainability. Always check for updates to rules, as they may vary between state and federal waters.</p>
